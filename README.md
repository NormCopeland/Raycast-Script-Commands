# Raycast Script Commands

A collection of [Raycast](https://raycast.com) script commands that I find useful.

## Script Commands

- [Open Salesforce Pages](open-salesforce-page.sh): Useful for Salesforce admins/consultants who work with a number of different orgs. This scripthas two dropdown arguments; the first used to select the client and the second is to select the page to open. You will need to update the code with your clients and their SF URLs.
